# Roblox-ip-logger
Ive linked the RBXM here. Contains the module that you need <br />
You need to use the webhook proxy for it to work: https://webhook.lewisakura.moe/ <br />
It also only gets the ip of the roblox server your playing due to the GET request only being able to be ran on the server.  <br />
So would it be a roblox server ip logger? idk
